[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkutz/spock-scope-extension.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkutz/warpcore) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/mkutz/warpcore.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/mkutz/warpcore) [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/de.assertagile.warpcore/warpcore.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22warpcore%22)

This might become a testframework for JVM based infrastructure tests mainly meant for the [Spock Framwork](http://spockframework.org). Like [Geb](http://www.gebish.org/) is providing a Selenium wrapper as a Browser object, Warpcore should provide an infrastructure representation as an Infrastructure object.
